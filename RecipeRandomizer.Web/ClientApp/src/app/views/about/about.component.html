            <p>
                The idea for this project came about during the 2020 pandemic lockdown, when I wanted to cook something but
                I didn't know what and I didn't want to rummage through all my cookbooks. I wanted a simple way to give me
                a random recipe. I found none that really fitted my needs, so I began coding my own randomizer application.
                Obvously I got carried away a "little" and it is now a full-blown web-app with database üòÖ
